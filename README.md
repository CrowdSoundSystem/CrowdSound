# Crowdsound
Seven for the She-lord in her hall of stone (Michaela)<br />
Nine for the Moral Men doomed to die, (Bros)<br />
One for the Pi on his dark thrown<br />
In the Land of Waterloo where the Shadows lie.<br />
One Sound to rule them all, One Sound to find them,<br />
One Sound to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br />
In the Land of Waterloo where the Shadows lie

## Building
Building is as simple as running `CMake`. However, it is recommended
to create a seperate directory for building. For example, from the project root:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

## Testing
There isn't really any testing done yet (if ever?) in an automated way.

## Running
To run the server, simple build the project (as shown above), and `bin/crowdsound`
For example from the build directory:

```
$ make
$ bin/crowdsound
```
